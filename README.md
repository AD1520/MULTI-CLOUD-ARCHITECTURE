# DESCRIPTION
As part of my internship at CodTech, I designed and implemented a Multi-Cloud Architecture demonstrating seamless interoperability between AWS and Microsoft Azure. The project involved hosting a React frontend on Azure Static Web Apps, which communicated with an AWS Lambda function through API Gateway. The Lambda function served dynamic responses, and proper CORS configuration ensured secure and smooth cross-origin communication between both cloud platforms. This setup showcased a real-world example of hybrid cloud deployment, combining the strengths of each provider to build a resilient, scalable, and flexible architecture. A detailed demo and documentation were created to highlight the implementation and integration process across platforms
